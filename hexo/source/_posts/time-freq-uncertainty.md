# Time-Frequency Uncertainty

The Uncertainty Principle is first proposed by Heisenberg to describe that you can't precisely measure the position and momentum of a particle at the same time. This principle is well known in quantum physics. It then became a very "general" idea, and can also be used in the field of signal processing. In this article, I will describe the time-frequency uncertainty principle theorem and then show the proof.
